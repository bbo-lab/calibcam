# Functions in this file will be subject to autograd and need to be written accordingly
# - Do not import functions that are not compatible with autograd
# - Autograd numpy used here
# - Do not use asarray, as it does not seem to differentiable
# - Do not use for loops
# - Do not use array assignment, e.g. A[i,j] = x

# These functions will properly broadcast as long as skipped dimensions are inserted as singular axes into input data.
#  E.g. rotmats_cams (n_cams, 3, 3) -> (n_cams, 1, 1, 3, 3)
